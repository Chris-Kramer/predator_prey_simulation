# predator_prey_simulation  
This is a small program, which simulates a predator-prey model, based on pseudo-randomness. It is currently not fully implemented, since its reporting of the results is currently a mock implementation. 
This project is part of an exam at the Southern University of Denmark.  

This code is a collaboration between 
Andreas Lykke (forzadata https://github.com/forzadata), Christoffer Kramer (Chris-Kramer https://github.com/Chris-Kramer), and Merete Hansen (MereteH https://github.com/MereteH)
